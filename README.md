# Grafana Monitoring and Alerting Application

## Introduction
This project provides a Docker-based monitoring and alerting solution using primarily Prometheus, Grafana, Node Exporter and MSSQL, allowing a user to monitor the health of devices, databases and other services. It was created as a way to learn how the technologies work and can be deployed through Docker, and is therefore relatively introductory and a work in progress.

## Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started
To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Start the Docker monitoring stack:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
